            "  - Layer: Environment abstract : Electrocatalysis is projected to play a key role in building a sustainable world based on renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\n",
            " Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoSx) and crystalline (c-MoS2) forms have attracted attention.1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties.2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoSx films to transform into highly active a-MoS2. C-MoS2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions.3\n",
            " \n",
            " Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes.4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiSx and Co9S8,6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\n",
            " Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered.\n",

            "  - Layer: Process abstract : Electrocatalysis is projected to play a key role in building a sustainable world based on renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\n",
            " Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoSx) and crystalline (c-MoS2) forms have attracted attention.1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties.2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoSx films to transform into highly active a-MoS2. C-MoS2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions.3\n",
            " \n",
            " Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes.4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiSx and Co9S8,6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\n",
            " Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered.\n",

The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form.

Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\n",

            "Electrocatalysis is projected to play a key role in building a sustainable world based on renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\n",

            "  - Layer: Environment abstract : Rational design of efficient pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts to enable large‐scale hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting is of great significance, yet a challenging task. Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M = Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 12.3 mV; η100 = 52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF) = 4.7 s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10 = 12.9 mV; η100 = 43.5 mV) with a TOF of 4.5 s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts. categories : {'Acidic': ['pH < 7', 'pH<7', 'pH<', 'pH 1', 'pH=1', 'acidic'], 'Alkaline': ['pH > 7', 'pH>7', 'pH>', 'pH=14', 'alkaline', 'basic'], 'Neutral': ['pH 7', 'neutral pH'], 'Operating Temperature': ['temperature', '25°C', '80°C', 'temperature-controlled'], 'Pressure': ['1 atm', '10 atm', 'high-pressure', 'pressure'], 'Gas-Phase Reactions': ['gas-phase', 'gas reaction'], 'Non-aqueous Solvents': ['non-aqueous', 'organic solvent', 'ethanol']}\n",

The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers.

            "Rational design of efficient pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts to enable large‐scale hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting is of great significance, yet a challenging task. Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M = Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 12.3 mV; η100 = 52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF) = 4.7 s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10 = 12.9 mV; η100 = 43.5 mV) with a TOF of 4.5 s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts.\n",

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M = Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 12.3 mV; η100 = 52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF) = 4.7 s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10 = 12.9 mV; η100 = 43.5 mV) with a TOF of 4.5 s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts. categories : {'Metal Oxides': ['Fe2O3', 'NiO', 'oxide layer', 'metal oxide'], 'Metal Phosphides': ['Ni2P', 'FeP', 'metal phosphide catalyst'], 'Sulfides, Nitrides, Carbides': ['MoS2', 'nitrides', 'carbides', 'WS2'], 'Core–Shell Nanostructures': ['core-shell', 'encapsulated nanoparticles'], '2D Materials': ['graphene', 'MoS2', 'nanosheets'], 'Porous Structures, Nanorods, Nanowires': ['nanorods', 'nanowires', 'porous', 'mesoporous', 'nanoporous']}\n",

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M = Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 12.3 mV; η100 = 52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF) = 4.7 s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10 = 12.9 mV; η100 = 43.5 mV) with a TOF of 4.5 s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts. categories : {'Green Hydrogen Economy': ['green hydrogen', 'H2 economy', 'renewable hydrogen'], 'Hydrogen Production': ['H2 production', 'hydrogen generation'], 'Renewable Energy Integration': ['solar + water splitting', 'renewable system', 'wind-driven electrolysis'], 'PEM Electrolyzer': ['proton exchange membrane', 'PEM electrolyzer', 'membrane cell'], 'Lithium-Ion Battery': ['LIB', 'lithium battery', 'anode', 'cathode']}\n",

Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.

            "  - Layer: Process abstract : Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1. categories : {'Electrochemical Energy Conversion': ['electrochemical cell', 'redox energy', 'electrochemical process'], 'Water Electrolysis': ['electrolysis of water', 'splitting H2O', 'hydrogen from water'], 'Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting': ['photoelectrochemical', 'PEC water splitting', 'solar water splitting'], 'Photocatalysis': ['photocatalyst', 'UV-activated', 'light-driven catalysis'], 'Thermochemical Water Splitting': ['high-temperature splitting', 'thermal decomposition of water'], 'Electrocatalysis': ['electrocatalyst', 'electrocatalytic', 'electrode reaction enhancement'], 'Fuel Cells': ['fuel cell', 'proton exchange membrane', 'PEM', 'electricity generation from fuel']}\n",

            "  - Layer: Elemental Composition abstract : Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1. categories : {'Iron': ['Fe', 'iron-based catalyst', 'Fe3+', 'Fe2+'], 'Nickel': ['Ni', 'nickel foam', 'nickel oxide'], 'Cobalt': ['Co', 'Co3O4', 'cobalt-doped'], 'Manganese': ['Mn', 'manganese oxide'], 'Molybdenum': ['Mo', 'MoS2', 'molybdenum disulfide'], 'Transition Metals': ['transition metal', 'd-block metal', 'first-row metals'], 'Earth-Abundant Elements': ['earth-abundant', 'non-precious', 'low-cost metals'], 'Metal-Free Catalysts': ['carbon-based', 'N-doped graphene', 'non-metal'], 'Dopants': ['doped with P', 'S-doping', 'boron doping']}\n",

            "  - Layer: Performance & Stability abstract : Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.

            "title_text : (invited) atomic layer deposited sulfides as (pre)catalysts for electrochemical water splitting\n",
            "abstract_map : Electrocatalysis is projected to play a key role in building a sustainable world based on renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\n",
            " Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoSx) and crystalline (c-MoS2) forms have attracted attention.1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties.2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoSx films to transform into highly active a-MoS2. C-MoS2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions.3\n",
            " \n",
            " Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes.4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiSx and Co9S8,6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\n",
            " Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered.\n",

            "title_text : activating ru in the pyramidal sites of ru2p‐type structures with earth‐abundant transition metals for achieving extremely high her activity while minimizing noble metal content\n",
            "abstract_map : Rational design of efficient pH‐universal hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts to enable large‐scale hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting is of great significance, yet a challenging task. Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M = Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 12.3 mV; η100 = 52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF) = 4.7 s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10 = 12.9 mV; η100 = 43.5 mV) with a TOF of 4.5 s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts.\n",
            "title_text : polyoxometalate electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals for efficient water oxidation in acidic media.\n",
            "abstract_map : Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1.\n"

Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\\n Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoSx) and crystalline (c-MoS2) forms have attracted attention.1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties.2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoSx films to transform into highly active a-MoS2. C-MoS2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions.3\\n \\n Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes.4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiSx and Co9S8,6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\\n Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered.\\n References\\n [1] Mattinen, Leskelä, Ritala, Adv.

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M\\u2009=\\u2009Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5\\u2009M H2SO4 (η10\\u2009=\\u200912.3\\u2009mV; η100\\u2009=\\u200952\\u2009mV; turnover frequency (TOF)\\u2009=\\u20094.7\\u2009s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10\\u2009=\\u200912.9\\u2009mV; η100\\u2009=\\u200943.5\\u2009mV) with a TOF of 4.5\\u2009s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts.', '07b4ed4fa076e59046a5d97f5f815d55378888db': 'Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1.'}\n",

Electrochemical water splitting produces H2 on the cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER), which can be used as a fuel and reactant in diverse industries. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) producing O2 at the anode is a complex reaction that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolyzers. Active, stable, and affordable catalysts are required for both reactions. The range of potential catalysts has expanded from metals and oxides to others, sulfides having become one of the most actively studied material groups. Our work focuses on understanding inherent activity and structural changes under HER and OER conditions.\\n Different water electrolyzer technologies subject the catalysts to different operating conditions, which limits the available catalyst materials. For proton exchange membrane electrolyzers featuring an acidic environment, platinum group metals are currently used. However, several earth abundant catalysts have been identified for HER in acid. Among these, molybdenum sulfides in both amorphous (a-MoSx) and crystalline (c-MoS2) forms have attracted attention.1 We developed a plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) process that can deposit both amorphous MoSx with adjustable S/Mo ratio (2.8–4.7) and crystalline MoS2 with different crystallinity, morphology, and electrical properties.2 Electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 combined with ex situ and quasi in situ XPS revealed a-MoSx films to transform into highly active a-MoS2. C-MoS2 films were less active and did not show structural changes under HER conditions.3\\n \\n Alkaline electrolyzers and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers operate under alkaline conditions and use earth abundant Fe/Co/Ni based catalysts. Most if not all materials based on these metals convert to oxyhydroxides under the highly oxidizing OER conditions and readily incorporate iron present in electrolytes.4,5 Thus, the as-deposited OER catalysts are best described as precatalysts. We developed new ALD processes to deposit NiSx and Co9S8,6,7 while oxide, metal, and hydroxide thin films were deposited for comparison using different methods. Extensive electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with controlled Fe impurities combined with ex situ XPS revealed that in absence of iron all the Ni-based precatalysts convert to an OER-active oxyhydroxide, yet at substantially different rates (NiSx ≈ Ni(OH)2 >> Ni > NiO).8 However, good OER activity and stability was only achieved in the presence of Fe impurities. The highest amount of iron incorporation and the best OER performance was found for the NiSx and Ni(OH)2 precatalysts, which convert the fastest into the active oxyhydroxide form. Studies on Co-based OER precatalysts are currently ongoing, including use of operando characterization methods.\\n Our studies on ALD sulfides as both HER and OER catalysts showcase the importance of understanding catalyst structure and its changes under catalytic conditions. Armed with this knowledge and unique capabilities of ALD, catalysts with higher performance in electrolyzer applications can be designed and engineered.\\n References\\n [1] Mattinen, Leskelä, Ritala, Adv.

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M\\u2009=\\u2009Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2−xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P‐type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory calculations, a significant increase in the Ru d‐band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state‐of‐the‐art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt‐like activity in 0.5\\u2009M H2SO4 (η10\\u2009=\\u200912.3\\u2009mV; η100\\u2009=\\u200952\\u2009mV; turnover frequency (TOF)\\u2009=\\u20094.7\\u2009s−1). It remains extraordinarily active in alkaline conditions (η10\\u2009=\\u200912.9\\u2009mV; η100\\u2009=\\u200943.5\\u2009mV) with a TOF of 4.5\\u2009s−1, which is 4x higher than that of Ru2P and 10x that of Pt/C. Further increase in the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where, for example, the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than that of Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost‐efficient catalysts.', '07b4ed4fa076e59046a5d97f5f815d55378888db': 'Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH < 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1.'}\n",
