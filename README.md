# ðŸ§  SOKE Graph: Scientific Ontology-Knowledge Extraction Pipeline

SOKE Graph is a powerful, end-to-end pipeline designed to extract structured knowledge from scientific PDFs using ontology-driven classification and AI-assisted language models. It enables automated discovery and categorization of domain-specific informationâ€”such as catalyst types, reaction conditions, and performance metricsâ€”by parsing research papers, classifying concepts across multiple layers (e.g., Process, Environment, Reaction), and storing the results in a Neo4j knowledge graph.

This tool is especially tailored for accelerating literature analysis in material science fields like green hydrogen production and water electrolysis.
